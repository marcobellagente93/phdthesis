\chapter{Introduction}\label{chap:introduction}

\vspace*{-2pt}
The motivation behind the prediction of a fundamental scalar particle in the Standard Model (SM), 
the Higgs boson, was to grant
a mechanism for the generation of the masses of the electroweak gauge bosons via 
electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB)~\cite{Higgs:1964pj,Higgs:1964ia,Englert:1964et}. 
The discovery of a Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)~\cite{Aad:2012tfa,Chatrchyan:2012xdj} 
%and precision analyses of its properties 
strongly hints at EWSB indeed being the mechanism behind the mass generation of the SM particles.
One of the pivotal tasks of the LHC and future colliders is to probe both the local and global structure of the Higgs 
potential,
%While after EWSB the local properties of the Higgs potential in the vicinity of the electroweak vacuum 
which is reflected in the couplings of the Higgs boson to other SM particles and in its
self-coupling, respectively. 
%With the end of LHC Run~II and its experimental legacy coming in, 
In this thesis, we present a global view on Higgs couplings at the LHC
to extend our understanding of the EWSB sector and
to set universal constraints on new physics that might be hiding in it.
\\ \medskip \vspace*{-2pt}

Driven by the question what current data reveal about the  
EWSB sector and new physics that might be hiding in it, in this thesis 
we aim at increasing the precision of Higgs-coupling measurements 
and combining them in a comprehensive framework. 
This requires us to rethink the way we perform,  
interpret and combine experimental analyses in a way that fully exploits the available data. 
To tackle this challenge, we take a multi-prong approach:
First, we focus on the improvement of an individual Higgs-production and decay
channel by applying modern analysis techniques. Second, we perform global 
analyses of the Higgs-gauge sector for the LHC and a potential future upgrade 
of the LHC in a model-independent framework.
\\ \medskip \vspace*{-2pt}

Motivated by the experimental advances of LHC Run~II, we perform a global fit of the Higgs-gauge sector 
based on Higgs and di-boson measurements as well as electroweak precision data in Chapter~\ref{chap:fit13TeV}. 
We include momentum-related kinematic distributions 
%for Higgs production in association with a vector 
%boson and for di-boson production. 
and examine the impact of the different LHC Run~II measurements on the reach of our 
global analysis in detail. 
On the theory side, we broaden our view on the Higgs sector by expanding 
the set of considered dimension-six operators from~10 to~18 with respect to 
previous \textsc{SFitter} analyses~\cite{Corbett:2015ksa,Butter:2016cvz}.
This extension of our operator set will bring 
us a significant step closer to a global SMEFT fit at dimension six.
%The  considered are constrained by electroweak precision data.
We discuss how the additional fermionic Higgs-gauge operators have a relevant 
impact on a global fit of the Higgs-gauge sector
despite the strong constraints from electroweak precision data.

In Chapter~\ref{cha:conclusion}, we will summarize our results and give an 
outlook to further improvements and extensions of the concepts discussed 
in this thesis. 
%
Each of the lines of research mentioned above will aid in constructing a global view of Higgs 
couplings at the LHC as well as its proposed future upgrade 
and will bring us one step closer to probing if EWSB
is indeed described by the simple structure of the SM Higgs potential.
The derived limits on Higgs couplings in the SMEFT framework 
can be mapped onto constraints for UV-complete BSM models~\cite{deBlas:2017xtg,Ellis:2018gqa}.
Furthermore, they provide a key ingredient for future tests of the global structure of the Higgs potential. 
In summary, the thorough investigation of Higgs couplings at the LHC is crucial 
to gain a deeper understanding of the structure of the Higgs sector and EWSB on a fundamental level.
