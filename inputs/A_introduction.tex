The extensive physics program of the ATLAS experiment [1] at the Large Hadron Collider [2] relies on high-fidelity Monte Carlo (MC) simulation as a basis for hypothesis tests of the underlying distribution of the data. One of the key detector technologies used for characterizing collisions are calorimeters, measuring the energy and location of both charged and neutral particles traversing the detector. Particles will lose their energy in a cascade (called a shower) of electromagnetic and hadronic interactions with a dense absorbing material. The number of the particles produced in these interactions is subsequently measured in thin sampling layers of an active medium.
The deposition of energy in the calorimeter due to a developing shower is a stochastic process that can not be described from first principles and rather relies on a precise simulation of the detector response. It requires the modeling of interactions of particles with matter at the microscopic level as implemented using the Geant4 toolkit. This simulation process is inherently slow and thus presents a bottleneck in the ATLAS simulation pipeline.

To meet the growing analysis demands, ATLAS already relies strongly on fast calorimeter simulation techniques based on thousands of individual parametrizations of the calorimeter response in the longit- udinal and transverse direction given a single particle’s energy and pseudorapidity [5]. The algorithms currently employed for physics analyses by the ATLAS collaboration achieve a significant speed-up over the full simulation of the detector response at the cost of accuracy. Current developments [6, 7] aim at improving the modeling of taus, jet-substructure-based boosted objects or wrongly identified objects in the calorimeter and will benefit from an improved detector description following data taking and a more detailed forward calorimeter geometry.
In recent years, deep learning algorithms have been demonstrated to accurately model the underlying distributions of rich, structured data for a wide range of problems, notably in the areas of computer vision, natural language processing and signal processing. The ability to embed complex distributions in a low dimensional manifold has been leveraged to generate samples of higher dimensionality and approximate the underlying probability densities. Among the most promising approaches to generative models are Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs) [8, 9] and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), shown to simulate the response of idealized calorimeters.

This note presents the first application of such models to the fast simulation of the calorimeter response of the ATLAS detector, demonstrating the feasibility of using such algorithms for large scale high energy physics experiments in the future, and opens the possibility to complement current techniques. The studies presented in this note focus on generating showers for photons over a range of energies in the central region of the electromagnetic calorimeter. These showers are easier to reproduce and thus studied first, in particular the longitudinal and lateral shower shapes. Through the simplifications made, it is possible to focus on narrow regions of the calorimeter and neglect the dependence of the calorimeter response on the incident particle’s pseudorapidity. Furthermore, the extension of the algorithms for different particle types through conditioning the models on these types, is not studied.
The note is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the design of the ATLAS detector and the geometry of the calorimeter system in particular. The Monte Carlo simulation samples used are described in Section 3. Section 4 presents a comprehensive summary of the deep generative models exploited in this work as well as their optimization. The results obtained by these algorithms are reviewed in Section 5. The final section concludes the note with a discussion of the work.
