\section*{Abstract}

After the discovery of a Higgs boson, the particle physics community
desperately tries to find ways to survive and to be relevant somehow
for fundamental physics. Besides an endless unsuccessful EFT approach
in ``finding'' new physics, and painful higher order calculation,
machine learning has become an increasingly attractive target to dump
all the research money coming from the government. 

If you want to do yourself a favour, do not read this thesis. It is a
collection of projects carried out at the Plehn Institute for Machine
Learning (PIML). Whereas the PIML considers themselves as one of the
leading groups in machine learning in particle physics, I can
guarantee that throughout my PhD I noticed that this sounds much
better than it is....
