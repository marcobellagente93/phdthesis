{\bf LHC analyses directly comparing data and simulated events bear the
  danger of using first-principle predictions only as a black-box
  part of event simulation. We show how simulations, for instance, of
  detector effects can instead be inverted using generative
  networks. This allows us to reconstruct parton level information
  from measured events. Our results illustrate how, in general, fully
  conditional generative networks can statistically invert Monte Carlo
  simulations. As a technical by-product we show how a maximum mean
  discrepancy loss can be staggered or cooled.}
