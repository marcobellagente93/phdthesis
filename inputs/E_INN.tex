\section*{Abstract}
{\bf For simulations where the forward and the inverse directions have
  a physics meaning, invertible neural networks are especially useful.
  A conditional INN can invert a detector simulation in terms of
  high-level observables, specifically for ZW production at the
  LHC. It allows for a per-event statistical interpretation. Next, we
  allow for a variable number of QCD jets. We unfold detector effects
  and QCD radiation to a pre-defined hard process, again with a
  per-event probabilistic interpretation over parton-level phase
  space.}
